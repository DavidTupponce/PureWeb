# How to use ?
Simply download the binaries and execute the appropriated one (Linux or Windows). Otherwise, you can compile it's source code itself.
You just need any Purebasc version (Free or licensed) up to the 5.50 LTS. Compile the main.pb file to build the server. For installation details of Purebasic, please refer to the official website at http://www.purebasic.com

# Setting up the server
You'll need a 'www' directory in witch you can put all your files needed on the Web (ex : your site or applications). Just put your files in the 'www' directory, run the server, and go to http://localhost. That's it.
